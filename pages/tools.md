# SWIFT Codes
The SWIFT lab maintains a library of Matlab codes used for analyzing various types of field data. These codes were primarily developed for the instrumentation packages included on the [SWIFT](http://www.apl.washington.edu/swift){:target="blank"} floats and wavegliders, but since can be expanded for a variety of uses.

*[SWIFTcodes currently exists as an in-house collection maintained on Dropbox. We are in the process of migrating these codes to GitHub for public access. If you are interested in making used of these codes prior to migration, please contact me. ]*

# My Github Page
Any additional tools that I develop can be found on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/sdbrenner).


# Other useful resources
In addition to the tools developed in my lab or by myself personally, a number of members of the oceanographic and scientific community maintain websites and code repositories.  A few of these are listed below:

* [Ocean Mixing Community GitHub repository](https://github.com/OceanMixingCommunity){:target="blank"}
* [SEA-MAT](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/){:target="blank"}
