{:refdef}

I am a PhD candidate at the School of Oceanography and the Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington.
I work under the joint supervision of [Luc Rainville](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Rainville&first_name=Luc){:target="blank"} and [Jim Thomson](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Thomson&first_name=Jim){:target="blank"}. My research focus is on dynamic links between sea ice and the upper ocean in the Arctic's Beaufort Sea, with a specific focus on atmosphere-ice-ocean momentum transfer.

I started at UW in 2017 after completing a Masterâ€™s of Applied Science degree (MASc) in Civil Engineering at the University of British Columbia, where I worked under the supervision of [Bernard Laval](https://www.civil.ubc.ca/faculty/bernard-laval){:target="blank"}. During my master's, I studied standing wave structures in lakes.


# my research

I have an interest in studying dynamic processes in the near-surface Arctic ocean and within inland water bodies. My research primarily considers these processes using a combination of observations and simple theory.
