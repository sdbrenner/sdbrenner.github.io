{:refdef}

I am a PhD candidate at the School of Oceanography and the Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington.
I work under the joint supervision of [Luc Rainville](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Rainville&first_name=Luc){:target="blank"} and [Jim Thomson](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Thomson&first_name=Jim){:target="blank"}.

I started at UW in 2017 after completing a Masterâ€™s of Applied Science degree (MASc) in Civil Engineering at the University of British Columbia, where I worked under the supervision of [Bernard Laval](https://www.civil.ubc.ca/faculty/bernard-laval){:target="blank"}.


# my research

I study dynamic processes in the near-surface Arctic Ocean. I am interested in how the ongoing changes in Arctic sea ice may impact atmosphere-ice-ocean interaction, and the associated climate feedback mechanisms. My primary focus is in how sea ice modulates the transfer of momentum from the atmosphere into the upper ocean. I consider this processes using a combination of in situ observations and simple theory.


My past research work at the University of British Columbia considered standing wave patterns in lakes.
