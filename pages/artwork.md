<!-- This is a photo gallery made from the static files in the `assets/img/pexels` folder.
I wanted to create automatically a simple gallery from a folder without having to create a markdown page as you would for the portfolio. -->

This digital artwork series that I've been working on, "*Ocean Robots*", celebrates some of the different and innovative tools researchers use for to study the ocean and sea ice. Some of these platforms are widely used and commercially available, while others are developed in-house by different research groups and only exist in limited quantities.

If you have recommendations for what I should draw next, or want to learn more about any of the platforms I've drawn so far [let me know](mailto:sdbren@uw.edu?subject=[Ocean Robots])!
