<!-- This is a photo gallery made from the static files in the `assets/img/pexels` folder.
I wanted to create automatically a simple gallery from a folder without having to create a markdown page as you would for the portfolio. -->


As a "rainy-day" hobby, I've taken up oceanography-themed digital art. I'm self-taught, and still constantly learning new tricks and techniques along with what looks good.

This artwork series celebrates some of the different and innovative tools researchers use to study the ocean and sea ice. Some of these platforms are widely used and commercially available, while others are developed in-house by different research groups and only exist in limited quantities. I've had a chance to work with or help deploy many these platforms myself.

I have a (growing) list of ideas for other platforms I might try to draw next, but I'm always interested in learning about new and different tools that would be fun to draw. So if you have recommendations for what I should draw next, or want to learn more about any of the platforms I've drawn so far [let me know](mailto:sdbren@uw.edu?subject=[Ocean Robots])!
