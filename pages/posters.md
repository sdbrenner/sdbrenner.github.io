title: '"ocean robots" posters'
layout: page
---

For fun, I've made at series of digital posters showcasing different and innovative autonomous tools that researchers use to study the ocean and sea ice. Some of these platforms are widely used and commercially available, while others are developed in-house by different research groups and only exist in limited quantities. I've had a chance to work with or help deploy many these platforms myself.

If you'd like [a print](https://twitter.com/SamuelDBrenner/status/1460358356837679105) of any of these, [please get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
