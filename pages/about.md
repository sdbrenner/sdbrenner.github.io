Since July 2022 I have been a post-doctoral researcher at Brown University, where I study the interactions of sea ice with the upper ocean.

At Brown, I work with [Chris Horvat](https://polar-oceans.com/) and am funded through Schmidt Futures as part of the [*Scale-Aware Sea Ice Project*](https://sasip-climate.github.io/).


I am a physical oceanographer, having earned my PhD from the School of Oceanography and the Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington in June, 2022. 
My background is in civil engineering; I earned both Bachelor's and Masterâ€™s of Applied Science (BASc and MASc) degrees from the University of British Columbia in 2015 and 2017, respectively.


At the University of Washington, I worked under the joint supervision of [Luc Rainville](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Rainville&first_name=Luc) and [Jim Thomson](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Thomson&first_name=Jim). 
My PhD focused on sea ice-ocean interactions and was titled: ["The role of sea ice in mediating atmosphere-ice-ocean momentum transfer"](http://hdl.handle.net/1773/49108).

My master's research at the University of British Columbia focused on physical limnology, under the supervision of [Bernard Laval](https://www.civil.ubc.ca/faculty/bernard-laval).
My master's thesis was titled: ["The free oscillatory response of fjord-type multi-armed lakes"](https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0353196).
