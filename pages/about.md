{:refdef}

I am a PhD student studying Oceanography at the University of Washington School of Oceanography and a research associate at the Applied Physics Lab.
I work under the joint supervision of [Luc Rainville](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Rainville&first_name=Luc){:target="blank"} and [Jim Thomson](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Thomson&first_name=Jim){:target="blank"}. My research focus is on dynamic links between sea ice and the upper ocean in the Arctic's Beaufort Sea, with a specific focus on atmosphere-ice-ocean momentum transfer.

I started at UW in 2017 after completing a Masterâ€™s of Applied Science degree (MASc) at the University of British Columbia.  My master's degree was awarded by the department of Civil Engineering in the *Environmental Fluid Mechanics* discipline group, where I worked under the supervision of [Bernard Laval](https://www.civil.ubc.ca/faculty/bernard-laval){:target="blank"} and studied standing wave structures in lakes - read more about that work on my [Research Page](/research/).



<!-- In May, 2019 I completed the requirements for a Master's of Science (MS; non-thesis) at UW based on a observational study of submesoscale frontal processes in the western Arctic marginal ice zone. -->
