Since July 2022 I have been a post-doctoral researcher at Brown University, where I work with [Chris Horvat](https://polar-oceans.com/) to study the interactions of sea ice with the upper ocean. My work is part of the [*Scale-Aware Sea Ice Project*](https://sasip-climate.github.io/){:target="blank"}.

I earned my PhD in 2022 from the School of Oceanography and the Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington under the joint supervision of [Luc Rainville](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Rainville&first_name=Luc){:target="blank"} and [Jim Thomson](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Thomson&first_name=Jim){:target="blank"}. Previous to that, I completed a Master’s of Applied Science degree (MASc) in Civil Engineering at the University of British Columbia in 2017, where I worked with [Bernard Laval](https://www.civil.ubc.ca/faculty/bernard-laval){:target="blank"}.
