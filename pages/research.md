# Summary and interests

I have an interest in studying dynamic processes in the near-surface region of the Arctic ocean and within inland water bodies.  My research considers these processes using an observational approach.  
<!-- For more details about the instrument platforms that I use, see my [Research Methods page](/methods/) -->

#### Density fronts in the Marginal Ice Zone
{: #MIZ}

![alt text](/assets/CurrentWork_MIZ.png "MIZ density fronts")

My current research focuses on the dynamic evolution of a small-scale upper-ocean front of cold, fresh water near the ice-edge within the Marginal Ice Zone.  This front was measured over a two-day span in the fall of 2014, and persists throughout the measurement period.  I am trying to determine what balance controls the evolution of the front and how it impacts the exchange of heat within the ocean and across the atmosphere-ocean interface.  

I presented a poster on this work at the 2018 Ocean Sciences Meeting in Portland, OR (see my [publications](/publications/#posters) page to download it).

This project uses data collected as part of the Office of Naval Research MIZ program.  For more details about the program, see the project site at:

#### Stratified Ocean Dynamics of the Arctic
{: #SODA}

I am a project member of the Office of Naval Research's Stratified Ocean Dynamics of the Arctic program.  This program is focused on understanding the changes to the upper ocean stratification associated with decreasing summer sea ice and increased open water extent.

#### Barotropic seiche modes in complex basins
{: #seiches}

At the University of British Columbia, I studied the effect of geometry on the standing wave modes (or seiches) that can be present within multi-armed fjord-type lakes.  My work involved the development of a simplified analytical model to determine modal periods and structures.  Together with collaborators, I am continuing to compare the predictions made by analytical model to real-world observations in lakes in both Canada and Italy.
