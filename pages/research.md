My current research focuses on the interactions between sea ice and the upper ocean, using a combination of *in situ* measurements, hierarchies of idealized models, and coupled Earth system models (ESMs).
I aim to understand the physical processes that shape these coupled systems, particularly the mechanisms that govern momentum and heat exchange.
This process-level understanding supports the development of parameterization schemes for unresolved processes in lower-resolution ESMs.

<!-- My current research focuses broadly on the interactions between sea ice and the upper ocean using a combination of *in situ* measurements and idealized modelling approaches.
I strive to comprehend these interactions at a process-level, aiming to unravel the underlying mechanisms and dynamics governing these connected systems, and how they may be impacted by the changing climate. 
By attaining an in-depth understanding of these processes, I hope to facilitate the development of parameterization schemes that can be incorporated into lower-resolution models used in climate studies. -->

## Approaches

#### Observations


I have been fortunate to participate in a number of field research campaigns, including a field camp on Ellesmere Island as an undergraduate research assistant, and three separate large-scale ocean research cruises in the Arctic and North Atlantic during my PhD. My PhD work focussed on measurements made from moorings deployed and recovered during those cruises.
