# SWIFT Codes
The SWIFT lab maintains a library of Matlab codes used for analyzing various types of field data. These codes were primarily developed for the instrumentation packages included on the [SWIFT](http://www.apl.washington.edu/swift) floats but since have been expanded for a variety of uses.
