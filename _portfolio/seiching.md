At the University of British Columbia, I studied the effect of geometry on the standing wave modes (or seiches) that can be present within multi-armed fjord-type lakes. My work involved the development of a simplified analytical model to determine modal periods and structures.
The model describes these lakes as interconnected longitudinal basins which are coupled at the confluence.

The main results of this work are (1) a simple formula for predicting the modal frequencies ($$\omega$$ that satisfy):

$$
  \sum_i^N \sqrt{gH_i} \tan\left(\frac{L_i\omega}{\sqrt{gH_i}}\right) = 0
$$,

and (2), the identification that under certain geometric constraints, there can be an additional set of "decoupled" modes in which only 2 arms of any given lake are active.

This research formed the basis for my Masters Thesis at UBC: [The free oscillatory response of fjord-type multi-armed lakes](https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0353196).
I also presented a poster about this work at the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society Congress in 2017, and published a paper about the analytical model in Limnology and Oceanography: [**Seiche modes in multi-armed lakes**](https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11001).




Together with collaborators, I am continuing to compare the predictions made by analytical model to real-world observations in lakes in both Canada and Italy, and have a manuscript *in prep*.
