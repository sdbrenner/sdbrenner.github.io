Freshwater input from the melting of sea ice can lead to strong lateral density gradients in the marginal ice zone.
These gradients are thought to be unstable to submesoscale instabilties and restratification.

Using a novel set of observations taken during the Office of Naval Research "Marginal Ice Zone" (MIZ) program in 2014, I showed the dynamic evolution of one such small-scale upper-ocean front over the course of just a few days. This frontal adjustment was concurrent with changes in the ice edge character, with a shift from a compact ice edge to one that was diffuse and filamented with coherent vortical structures.

I presented posters on this work at the 2018 Ocean Sciences Meeting in Portland, OR and the 2019 Li√®ge Colloquium on Ocean Dynamics in Belgium (see my [publications page](/publications/) to download them), and published a paper in the journal "Elementa" in 2020:
[**The evolution of a shallow front in the Arctic marginal ice zone**](https://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.413)
