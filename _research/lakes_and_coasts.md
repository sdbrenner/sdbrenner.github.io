My masters degree at the University of British Columbia focused on the study of lakes, and I maintain an interest in research on inland and coastal waters.

My work at UBC focused on the role of lake geometry in controlling the free barotropic response, specifically for multi-armed lakes. I developed a simple analytical model that predicts coupling/decouping between the arms of the lake ([Brenner & Laval, 2018](#Brenner2018)), and tested it by comparing with a finite-element model (e.g., [fig. 1](#fig1)) and observations from Quesnel Lake, in Canada, and Lake Como, in Italy.

Through my PhD, I was an active member of the [Environmental Fluid Mechanics](http://depts.washington.edu/uwefm/wordpress/) group at the University of Washington, which includes researchers with a strong focus on coastal oceangraphy, amoung other topics. While my PhD research never involved coastal work, I nonetheless involved myself in it where I could, including attending the [Estuarine and Coastal Dynamics Summer School](https://fhl.uw.edu/courses/course-descriptions/course/estuarine-and-coastal-fluid-dynamics-2019/) and participating in some coastal fieldwork in the Salish Sea.


<!-- I do not have any ongoing projects related to inland and coastal waters, but maintain an interest in these subjects  -->
In the future, I would be happy to bridge some of my ongoing research in ice-ocean interaction with these topics, and welcome ideas for collaborations about, e.g., ice-covered lakes or ice-ocean interactions coastal settings.
