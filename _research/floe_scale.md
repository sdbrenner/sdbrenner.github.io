Within the marginal ice zone (MIZ), sea ice is comprised of a mosaic of individual floes that span a wide range of horizontal scales—from meters to tens of kilometers across. 

However, when considering air-sea coupling at climate model scales, the role of sea ice variability is typically collapsed to a single metric: the sea ice concentration. 
As a result, the spatial heterogeniety in surface properities that is an inherent feature of the floe-covered MIZ is not resolved or accounted for. 
Yet, there is an increasing awareness that sea ice melt rates and atmosphere/ocean boundary layer dynamics are impacted by floe-scale effects.

Explicit representation of sea ice floes—as opposed to traditional continuum models—introduces constraints on the ice velocity field, as the floes move as solid bodies.
Because ice-ocean fluxes are driven by differences between sea ice and ocean velocity, these velocity constraints can impact the [transfers of momentum](/research/momentum_transfer) and energy across the atmosphere-ice-ocean boundary in a way that depends on the relative horizontal scales of floes and the scales of ocean variablity ([fig. 1](#fig1)).

My ongoing postdoctoral work at Brown University makes use of high-resolution, discrete element modelling of sea ice that explicitly resolves individual sea ice floes ([see video](#floedyn_video)).
Through these simlulations, I am investigating scale-dependent impacts on ice-ocean coupling and surface fluxes to understand the joint roles of *floe-floe interactions* and *flow-floe interactions*.
