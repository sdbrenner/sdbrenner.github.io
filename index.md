## Summary
I have an interest in studying dynamic processes in the near-surface region of the Arctic ocean and within inland water bodies.  My research considers these processes using an observational approach.  


## About Me

I am a PhD student studying Oceanography at the University of Washington (UW) under the joint supervision of [Luc Rainville](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Rainville&first_name=Luc){:target="blank"} and [Jim Thomson](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Thomson&first_name=Jim){:target="blank"}.  I started at UW in 2017 after completing a Master’s of Applied Science Degree (MASc) at the University of British Columbia.  My master's degree was awarded by the department of Civil Engineering in the *Environmental Fluid Mechanics* discipline group, where I worked under the supervision of [Bernard Laval](https://www.civil.ubc.ca/faculty/bernard-laval){:target="blank"} and studied standing wave structures in lakes.
In May, 2019 I completed the requirements for a Master's of Science (MS; non-thesis) at UW based on a observational study of submesoscale frontal processes in the western Arctic marginal ice zone.

<!-- My interest and current focus is on small-scale processes and mixing in the upper ocean; more information can be found on my [Research page](/research/). -->
