I am an (incoming) post-doctoral scholar at Brown University, working under the supervision of Chris Horvat.

Prior to starting my post-doc, I earned at PhD from the School of Oceanography and the Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington under the joint supervision of [Luc Rainville](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Rainville&first_name=Luc){:target="blank"} and [Jim Thomson](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Thomson&first_name=Jim){:target="blank"}. I also completed a Masterâ€™s of Applied Science degree (MASc) in Civil Engineering at the University of British Columbia, where I worked with [Bernard Laval](https://www.civil.ubc.ca/faculty/bernard-laval){:target="blank"}.


I study the interactions of sea ice with the upper ocean as part of the [*Antipodal Oceanography Group*](https://polar-oceans.com/){:target="blank"}.
