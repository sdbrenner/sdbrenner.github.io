## research

My research uses a combination of idealized process-level numerical models, *in situ* measurements, and coupled Earth-system models to understand the dynamic and thermodynamic processes linking sea ice and the upper ocean, and how those processes impact—and are impacted by—the changing Arctic climate.

More details about some of the specific problems that I consider and approaches that I use can be found on my [research page](/research). Also see [list of my publications](/publications). 

## collaboration

Science is a team sport.
I am always interested collaborating and connecting with other researchers. If you think our research might intersect or have ideas you want to discuss, [please get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
