# About Me

I am a PhD student studying Oceanography at the University of Washington under the joint supervision of [Luc Rainville](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Rainville&first_name=Luc){:target="blank"} and [Jim Thomson](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Thomson&first_name=Jim){:target="blank"}.  I started at UW in 2017 after completing a master's degree in applied science with a focus on environmental fluid mechanics in the Civil Engineering department at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC.  I previously completed a bachelors of applied science degree in Civil Engineering at UBC.

<!-- Though I was born in Alberta, I primarily grew up in Victoria, BC. After high-school, I worked in the bakery department of a grocery store as a cake decorator before getting a technical diploma in Civil Engineering Technology from Camosun College in 2010.  I spent a few years doing a combination of traveling, and working as an engineering technologist in the fields of construction management and wastewater design.  In 2013 I returned to Camosun College and completed the Civil Engineering Bridge program, which was an upgrading program that allowed me to join UBC's Civil Engineering program as a 3rd year student.   -->

My interest and current focus is on small-scale processes and mixing in the upper ocean; more details can be found on my [Research page](/research/).  This website details my research interests and activities.
