I passed my general exam and advanced to "PhD Candidate".
<!--more-->

In the School of Oceanography at UW, advancement to candidacy is based on successful completion of the general exam, which takes place sometime in the latter part of the PhD program.
The general exam is essentially a proposal of the work I plan to include in the final dissertation. It includes a combination of a written document and an oral presentation that give the background and scientific context of the planned work, together with methodologies and expected outcomes.

My proposal centers around the overarching research question of how sea ice modulates momentum flux into the ocean, and is titled *The role of sea ice in atmosphere-ice-ocean momentum transfer*.
I am planning on including four main projects in the dissertation, as layed out in the schematic below.
Two of these works (projects 1 and 2) are complete or nearly complete, while the remaining projects are ongoing.
