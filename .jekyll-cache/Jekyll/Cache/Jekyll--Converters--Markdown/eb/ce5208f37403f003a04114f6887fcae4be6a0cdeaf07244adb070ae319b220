I"a<p>The “Stratified Dynamics of the Arctic” (<strong>SODA</strong>) program is an Office of Naval Research project aiming to better understand the controls of heat, buoyancy, and momentum in the upper Beaufort Sea, and how those controls might be changing with sea ice loss.</p>

<p>In addition to a number of other observational tools and platforms, the program included an array of moorings across the Beaufort Sea, deployed for an annual cycle from Fall 2018 to Fall 2019.
My work within the project has focused on processing and analysis of those mooring data - especially the ocean and ice velocity, and ice geometry data from upward looking ADCPs on each of the moorings.</p>

<p>With these data, I am exploring questions about how sea ice impacts the momentum transfer from the wind into the upper ocean.</p>

<p>My initial focus was on the variations in the ice-ocean drag coefficient, where I’ve found that the growth and melt of ice keels can lead to highly seasonal drag which is modelled well by existing ice-ocean drag parameterizations (provided good input geometry). I presented a poster about this work at the 2020 Ocean Sciences Meeting in San Diego, and a talk at the 2020 virtual AGU meeting. I published a paper about this in JGR: Oceans in 2021:
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1029/2020JC016977"><strong>Comparing observations and parameterizations of ice-ocean drag through an annual cycle across the Beaufort Sea</strong></a>
(read my announcement post with some highlights from the paper <a href="/2021/04/01/new-paper.html"><em>here</em></a>).</p>
