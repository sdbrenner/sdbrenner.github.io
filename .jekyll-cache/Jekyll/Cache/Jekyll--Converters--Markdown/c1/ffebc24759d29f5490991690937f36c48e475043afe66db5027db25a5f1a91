<p>I am a PhD student studying Oceanography at the University of Washington School of Oceanography and a research associate at the Applied Physics Lab.
I work under the joint supervision of <a href="http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Rainville&amp;first_name=Luc" target="blank">Luc Rainville</a> and <a href="http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Thomson&amp;first_name=Jim" target="blank">Jim Thomson</a>. My research focus is on dynamic links between sea ice and the upper ocean in the Arctic‚Äôs Beaufort Sea, with a specific focus on atmosphere-ice-ocean momentum transfer.</p>

<p>I started at UW in 2017 after completing a Master‚Äôs of Applied Science degree (MASc) at the University of British Columbia.  My master‚Äôs degree was awarded by the department of Civil Engineering in the <em>Environmental Fluid Mechanics</em> discipline group, where I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://www.civil.ubc.ca/faculty/bernard-laval" target="blank">Bernard Laval</a> and studied standing wave structures in lakes - read more about that work on my <a href="/research/">Research Page</a>.</p>

<!-- In May, 2019 I completed the requirements for a Master's of Science (MS; non-thesis) at UW based on a observational study of submesoscale frontal processes in the western Arctic marginal ice zone. -->
