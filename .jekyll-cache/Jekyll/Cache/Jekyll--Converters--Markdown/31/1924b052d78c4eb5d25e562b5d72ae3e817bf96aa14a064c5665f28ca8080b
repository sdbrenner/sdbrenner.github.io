I"ˆ<p>At the University of British Columbia, I studied the effect of geometry on the standing wave modes (or seiches) that can be present within multi-armed fjord-type lakes. My work involved the development of a simplified analytical model to determine modal periods and structures.
The model describes these lakes as interconnected longitudinal basins which are coupled at the confluence.</p>
