The conference abstract can be found here: <a href="https://osm2022.secure-platform.com/a/gallery/rounds/3/details/3510"><strong>Seasonal variations of inertial velocities of sea ice and ocean surface layer in the Beaufort Sea</strong></a>, and is copied below</p>

<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>Previous studies have shown strong seasonal differences in the strength of inertial-frequency currents in the surface mixed layer of the Arctic, with relatively lower energy during the winter ice-covered period. These past observations suggest that sea ice inhibits the transfer of momentum from the wind into the ocean. As the Arctic sea ice pack shifts to a more seasonal regime, there are questions about what impact that will have on wind-driven velocities in the upper ocean. In this study, we use observations of sea ice and the upper ocean from a series of moorings in the Beaufort Sea to better understand atmosphere-ice-ocean momentum transfer, with a particular focus on the inertial-frequency response. These observations are interpreted using a simple 1D ice-ocean coupled “slab” model. Despite its simplicity, the model provides insight into some of the processes driving the observations and the differences between the moorings. We find that seasonality of near-surface currents is driven primarily by a combination of sea ice internal stresses and seasonal variations in the mixed layer depth. The parameterized strength of the sea ice internal stresses (represented by a linear damping coefficient) vary between moorings and have a strong dependence on sea ice concentration. Below ~80%-90% concentration, the ice moves in free drift and provides no damping on the mixed-layer inertial currents. Comparisons between the moorings show that inertial currents at the southernmost mooring (within the seasonal ice zone) are already minimally impacted by presence of sea ice even during the winter ice pack. Nonetheless, seasonal velocity variations are still present there due to the changes in mixed-layer depth.</p>
