I"Ï<!-- This is a photo gallery made from the static files in the `assets/img/pexels` folder.
I wanted to create automatically a simple gallery from a folder without having to create a markdown page as you would for the portfolio. -->

<p>As a ‚Äúrainy-day‚Äù hobby, I‚Äôve taken up oceanography-themed digital art. I‚Äôm self-taught, and still constantly learning new tricks and techniques along with what looks good.</p>

<p>This artwork series celebrates some of the different and innovative tools researchers use to study the ocean and sea ice. Some of these platforms are widely used and commercially available, while others are developed in-house by different research groups and only exist in limited quantities. I‚Äôve had a chance to work with or help deploy many these platforms myself.</p>

<p>I have a (growing) list of ideas for other platforms I might try to draw next, but I‚Äôm always interested in learning about new and different tools that would be fun to draw. So if you have recommendations for what I should draw next, or want to learn more about any of the platforms I‚Äôve drawn so far <a href="mailto:sdbren@uw.edu?subject=[Ocean Robots]">let me know</a>!</p>
